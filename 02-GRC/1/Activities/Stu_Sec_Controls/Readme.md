## Student Do: Implementing Security Controls

### Instructions

Welcome back!

In this activity, you will draft the final piece of recommendations submitted to GeldCorp.

You've already developed a full training plan, with target dates and a suggested delegation structure. However, training won't address the problem in the short term: It will take at least a quarter to train just 25% of the company. Improving the organization's security culture is a valuable long-term outcome, but the issue also needs to be mitigated immediately.

The training plan is a personnel security measure, and won't drastically reduce tailgating rates until at least next year. Consider _physical_, _technical_, or _procedural_ controls that would result in immediate reductions in employee piggybacking. 

1. Record _three_ different controls. They can be of any type you'd like. Answer the following questions about each control:
  - _How does this reduce tailgating?_
  - _What is the cost of implementation?_
  - _What percentage reduction in piggybacking rates do you expect?_

FYI: GeldCorp has deep pockets. They are willing to invest in innovative solutions to the problem. Be realistic and justify your suggestions, but budget is not a question if complex biometrics or other such systems are warranted.

Be sure to ask your instructors and classmates for help if you get stuck.

**Good luck!**
