## Student Do: Security Culture Framework Part 2

### Instructions

Welcome back!

In this exercise, you'll complete the action plan that you began drafting for your client in the first exercise.

Your plan will need to specify the following details:

1. **Involve the Right People**:: Identify the teams and/or managers involved, and explain how the security department should collaborate with them.

2. **Make an Action Plan**: Identify your "plan of attack". For example, you might propose to run a training; implement stricter security controls; some combination of the two; etc.

3. **Schedule**: Determine timelines for implementing your plan. Be specific: explain what will get done in terms of quarterly or annual goals.

4. **Metrics and KPIs**: Explain what you will measure to determine if your plan has been successful. Specify KPIs indicating what you want your plan to achieve. These are your planned goals.

5. **Measurements**: Explain how you will measure the success of your plan. Specify both when and how you'll measure results. Be detailed: If you're going to contract an assessment to a pentesting company, explain exactly what you'll have them do.

During review, you'll discuss an example solution to this problem. However, there are many good answers, so don't hesitate to be creativeâ€”but _do_ remember to justify every decision you make. 

**Good luck!**
