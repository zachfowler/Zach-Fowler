### Security Culture Framework Steps

- **Step 1**: The Security Culture Framework (SCF) Team meets privately to assess the impact of the phishing incident and understands the risk future campaigns pose to the organization. This discussion includes:

  - An assessment of the damages incurred by the previous phishing incident.

  - A measurement of how many employees download malicious files, obtained by having a pentesting firm launch a phishing attack against the company. This assessment might find a 10% click-through rate, meaning that 10% of employees download malicious email attachments.

  - Setting a target click-through rate. The team might decide that a 5% click-through rate is acceptable.

- **Step 2**: The SCF Team Manager (in this case, the IR manager) meets with the CISO to explain that the previous phishing attack was successful because 10% of employees often download arbitrary files from arbitrary email addresses. Then, they request a budget to execute a plan to bring this number down to 5% and explain how this would be profitable for the business.

- **Step 3**: The SCF Team develops a training plan that educates employees.

  - In addition, the SCF Team develops a _Supplemental Security Awareness_ training plan. This plan will be delivered only to employees who continue to click malicious links after training.

- **Step 4**: After developing the training, the SCF Team decides on incentives and disincentives. These incentives/disincentives will be awarded based on how employees behave during penetration tests and security audits. Since employees won't know exactly when these assessments are being conducted, the team expects greater adherence to the new download guidelines.

  - **Incentives for Not Clicking Through During Assessment**: $40 Gift Card, Free or Discounted Security Conference Attendance, Additional Vacation Time

  - **Disincentive for Clicking Through During Assessment**: Supplemental Security Awareness Training, Additional Random Device Audits for One Quarter

- **Step 5**: The SCF Team collaborates with HR to determine the best dates to run trainings. During these meetings, the HR Team explains that the most reliable way to ensure 100% attendance over the course of the next fiscal year is to have quarterly training sessions, and train 25% of employees each time. Together, they coordinate the specific dates and location of the training.

- **Step 6**: The SCF Team collaborates with Communications to develop and distribute information about the training.

- **Step 7**: The SCF Team sets up and runs the training as scheduled.

- **Step 8**: Every quarter, the SCF Team contracts the same pentesting firm to run the phishing campaign against all employees who have already been 
trained.

- **Step 9**: After every test, the SCF Team will identify employees who still clicked malicious links, and make them go through _Supplemental Security Awareness_ training. In addition, they will check to make sure that the click-through rate drops closer to 5%.

- **Step 10**: After training the entire company, the SCF Team will run a final phishing campaign to evaluate the overall effectiveness of the training. If they find that the click-through rate is 5% or lower, it can be considered a success. Otherwise, they may decide to run the training for an additional year, or take a different approach to solving the problem.
