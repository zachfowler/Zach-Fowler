## Activity: Documenting Company Policies

### Instructions

In the previous lesson, you performed a risk analysis to help _GeldCorp_ gain visibility into its most prominent threats. Since then, they've used your results to set numerous internal security goals.

In this exercise, you will help them realize these goals by developing and documenting policies to support them.

#### Internal Goals

Use one of the three following goals to develop a company policy. 

- Eliminate tailgating at all main offices.

  - **Note**: _Tailgating_ is when an employee holds the door open for others, thus allowing them to enter the building without scanning their ID.

- Guarantee 99% uptime for all trading applications.

- Reduce incidence of developers accessing customer PII that they don't need for their projects.

#### Policy Template

Use the following template to fill out your policies.

```
  DATE:
  AUTHOR:

  <Policy Name>

  PURPOSE
  What security benefit does this policy bring?

  DESCRIPTION OF <Policy Name>
  What are the terms of the policy?

  ENFORCEMENT
  How will this policy be enforced?

  MONITORING  
  How will the effectiveness of this policy be measured?
```

Work in pairs on this assignment, and don't hesitate to ask your instructional staff and/or classmates for help if you get stuck.
