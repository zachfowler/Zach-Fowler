## Activity File: Exploiting `tar`

In this exercise, you'll play the role of a penetration tester hunting for vulnerabilities in a target system's backup procedures.

In particular, you will use the `wildpwn.py` tool to verify that the system's current configuration is vulnerable to this kind of privilege escalation attack.

Afterwards, you will research and suggest two mitigation strategies to protect the server in the future.

### Instructions

1. Log in as `jane` and verify that you have no `sudo` rights.

2. Download the [wildpwn.py](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/localh0t/wildpwn/master/wildpwn.py) attack tool to your `~/Documents` directory. Do this from the command line, _not_ the browser.

     _**Hint**: Use `wget` or `curl`._

3. Use `wildpwn.py` to generate the malicious files. Move them to the `/home/jane/Documents/ExploitTar` directory, which you expect to be frequently backed up.

4.  In real life, you would wait for the system to trigger the malware by backing up the directory you saved it to. In this activity, `cron` will create the backup for you.
    - Wait a minute or two for `cron` to run. Then, verify that the backup created a `.cachefile` that you can use to escalate privileges. 

5. Run the malware to escalate to `root`. 

6. Add `jane` to `/etc/sudoers` so she can run any command with superuser privileges.

7. Log back in as `jane` and verify that you can run commands with `sudo`. Then, remove the `.cachefile` and `wildpwn.py` script to cover your tracks.

8. After verifying that you can indeed escalate privileges and modify the system to catastrophic effect, identify two ways to prevent this attack in the future.
