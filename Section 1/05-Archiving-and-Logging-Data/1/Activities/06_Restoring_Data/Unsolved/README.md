## Activity File: Restoring Data with `tar`

In this activity, you’ll continue as a junior administrator at *Rezifp Pharma Inc*.

- The E-Prescription Treatment database was attacked and the database was taken offline. 

- Fortunately, the team had a recent *full backup* and was able to recover the database, making the system operational.  However, a pharmacy technician noticed that some files in the Patient database were missing, and the team discovered that the wrong full backup was used.  The system was taken offline again.

- It is critical that the missing patient files are restored as soon as possible. You have spoken to the pharmacy technician and received a list of the names of patients whose files are missing.  

You have been asked to:

* List the contents of an archive to determine what it contains.

* Search inside the archive to locate patient names and confirm that the missing data is in the archive.

* Create a directory to restore the patient data for review.

* Extract only the patient files to the directory so they can be checked by the pharmacy technician. 

* Validate that the archive does not contain errors, using a new `tar` option.

### Instructions 

- If you are not logged in, log into the lab environment using:

    - Username: `sysadmin`  
    - Password: `cybersecurity`

1. Move to the `Documents/epscript/backup` directory.

2. List the contents of the directory to display the `20190814epscript.tar` file. You will search this archive for the missing patient data.

3. View the Patient directory and files in the archive.

    * List the contents of the archive and display the output to the screen in pages.

    * Locate the names of these patients in the `tar` archive:

        * Alan Lopez
        * John Good

        _**Hint**: Untar the file, then use `grep` to locate the patient records on each of the directories._

4. Extract the Patient directory from the `20190814epscript.tar` archive.  

    * Extract patient data to the `patient_search` directory in the `epscript/backup` directory.   

    * Test for any errors when extracting. This will check the integrity of the archive.

    _**Hint:** Find the `tar` option that validates and prints **error messages** with the **block number** in the archive file. [See man page here.](<https://www.gnu.org/software/tar/manual/html_section/tar_22.html>)_

5. List the contents of the `patient_search` directory to check that the Patient directory and files were extracted there.
