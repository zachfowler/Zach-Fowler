## Activity File: Creating Full Backups with `tar`

In this activity, you are a junior administrator at *Rezifp Pharma Inc.*  

- The company conducts clinical trials on drugs for oncology, immunology, and vaccines.  In recent weeks, there have been a series of malware attacks. The company is now strengthening its backup activities.   

- In response to the malware attacks, your department has decided to create daily *full backups* of the files associated with the E-Prescription Treatment database, which is the main system for many departments. 

You have been tasked with:

* Creating a name for the `tar` archive using the department's standard naming convention.
 
* Creating daily full backups of the directories and files in the `epscript` directory.

* Printing the file permission, owner, size, date, and time for each file in the archive.
 
* Verifying the archive after it is written to check for errors.

* Creating a file containing the output of the `tar` command for later review by the SysOps team, which will check file structure, permissions, and errors.

### Instructions

* To complete the activity, log into the lab environment using the following credentials:  
    - Username: `sysadmin` 
    - Password: `cybersecurity`

1. Move to the `/home/sysadmin/Documents` directory.

2. List the `epscript` directory contents and answer the following question:

    * What directories and files are located there? 

3. Prepare for performing the backup by standardizing the filenames.

    * Your department uses the [ISO 8601](<https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/iso-time.html>) standard for representing the date in the naming convention for all archives.    
        
        * Using the standard for representing the date, YYYY-MM-DD, allows sysadmins to locate an archive quickly.

        * Use the date **May 5, 2019** and convert it to the ISO 8601 format *without dashes*.

        * Add the filename `epscript.tar` to the end of the ISO 8601 date.

        * What is the archive name?

4.  Write a `tar` command that creates an archive with the following characteristics:

    * `[ISO_8601_date]epscript.tar` is the archive file name.

    * The file backup starts at the `epscript` directory and includes all directories and files contained within it.
        
    * File permission, owner, size, and date and time information are recorded for each file in the archive.    

    * The archive is verified after writing it, in order to validate the integrity of the data.

        _**Hint:** This is a new option. [See the man page](<http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/tar.1.html>)._

    * The output from the `tar` command is written to the file  `[archive_name].txt` for later review by the SysOps team to check file structure, permissions, and errors.

        * Note: `archive_name` is the `tar` archive name you created using `[ISO_8601_date]epscript.tar`.

5.  Execute your command and review the `.txt` file that contains the output.

    * What is displayed in the output file?
