## Unit 5: Archiving and Logging Data

By the end of each class, students will be able to:


### 5.1 Backups and Restoring Data with tar

* Identify and describe use cases for the three kinds of backups.
* Create (`tar`) an archive from existing files and directories.
* List and search the contents of an existing archive.
* Extract (`untar`) the contents of an archive.
* Describe and demonstrate two exploits for the tar command.


### 5.2 Cron and Scheduled Jobs

- Schedule regular jobs for individual users with `crontab`.
- Write simple scripts for maintenance and security tasks.
- Use `cron` to automate the execution of security scripts to perform maintenance on a regular basis.
- Learn how to defend against attacks that leverage the use of cron.


### 5.3 Managing and Monitoring Log Files

-  Filter `cron` and `boot` log messages using `journalctl` and `rsyslog`.
-  Build an alerting system using `tripwire` that records and generates alerts when logs are modified.
-  Perform log size management through the use of `logrotation`.
-  Install and configure audit rules using `auditd` that writes audit logs to disk.
