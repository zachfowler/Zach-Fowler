## Activity File: Log Size Management

In this activity, you are a junior administrator at Rezifp Pharma Inc. The company maintains a large database of patient data associated with patients, doctors, and their treatments. These files are maintained on a local server.

After installing and configuring Tripwire as your primary file manipulation detection system, you discovered that log files are deleted every morning.

Your organization currently does not have a log rotation scheme in place. Your CISO has asked that you create a `cron` job to rotate logs out every morning at 3 a.m. This is an effort to keep log files smaller and more manageable during backups.

### Instructions

The primary benefits of log rotation are preserving log entries and keeping log file sizes manageable. When a log file is rotated, the preserved log file can be compressed to save space.

Today you will create a log rotation scheme that keeps four weeks' worth of logs with a daily rotation that includes a maximum file size of 1 GB.


In your Ubuntu VM, launch a terminal. 

1. 	Check your Logrotate version for documentation purposes.

2. List the contents of `logrotate.d` to see what configuration files are present.

3. Configure the parameters for Logrotation by editing `/etc/logrotate.conf` to include the following parameters:

      -	A rotation scheme keeping four weeks of backlogs.

      -	Create new empty log files after rotating old ones.

      -	Do not rotate empty logs.

      -	Compress log files.


4. Add the following directories to be rotated:
    - `/var/log/auth.log`, parameters: `180 days of backlog`, `rotate daily`, `Don't rotate empty logs`, `Compress the file`, `Delay the compression`.


    - `/var/log/cron.log`, parameters: `60 days of backlog`, `rotate weekly`, `Don't rotate empty logs`, `Compress the file`, `Delay the compression`.


    - `/var/log/boot.log`, parameters: `30 days of backlog`, `rotate daily`, `Don't rotate empty logs`, `Compress the file`, `Delay the compression`.


5. Test the rotation by forcing Logrotation to rotate the logs by verifying the dates.
