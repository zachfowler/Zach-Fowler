### Activity File: Finding your Milky Way 
 
- You will continue in your role as security analyst at Wonka Corp, investigating the employee potentially selling secret recipes to Slugworth Corp.

- Your manager at Wonka Corp needs you to create an additional directory, as they believe there is a second employee working with Slugworth Corp.

- You also must copy and move several of the evidence files after creating this new directory.

**Instructions:**

Using only the command line, continue to complete the following tasks in the `student/take_5` folder in your Ubuntu VM:

  1. Create an additional folder called `Internal_Investigation_Employee_B`.

  2. Move the file `email_evidence` from `Internal_Investigation_Employee_A` to `Internal_Investigation_Employee_B`, as you have been told there will not be email evidence for the first employee.

  3. Copy the file `log_evidence` from `Internal_Investigation_Employee_A` to `Internal_Investigation_Employee_B`, as you have been told there will likely be log evidence from both employees.

  4. Check your directories to confirm the files are all in the correct locations.
