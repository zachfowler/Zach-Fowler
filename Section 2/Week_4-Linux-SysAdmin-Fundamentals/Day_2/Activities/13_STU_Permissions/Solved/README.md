## Solution Guide: Permissions

Start by inspecting the file permissions on each of the files listed, and determine if they are already set correctly or if you need to change the permissions.
  - Run: `ls -l <file1> <file2> <file3>`

Set permissions `600` on `/etc/shadow` (`rw` for root only).

  - Running `ls -l /etc/shadow` shows the permissions are set to `640`. 

  - Run: `sudo chmod 600 /etc/shadow`

Set permissions `600` on `/etc/gshadow` (`rw` for root only).

  - Running `ls -l /etc/gshadow` shows the permissions are set to `640`.

  - Run: `sudo chmod 600 /etc/shadow`

Set permissions `644` on `/etc/group` (`rw` for root and `r` for all others).

  - Running `ls -l /etc/group` shows that the permissions are already set to `644`.

Set permissions `644` on` /etc/passwd` (`rw` for root and `r` for all others).

  - Running `ls -l /etc/passwd` shows that the permissions are set to `666`.

  - Run: `sudo chmod 644 /etc/passwd`

Verify all accounts have passwords.

 - Running `sudo less /etc/shadow` shows the root user doesn't have a password.

  - We want to verify that each account has a password hash and not a `!` in the second field of each listing in the `/etc/shadow` file. `!` indicates that there is no password set for that user.



Verify that no users have UID of `0` besides `root`. If you find one that does, change it's UID to any value greater than `1000`.

- We are looking at the third field of each line in the `/etc/passwd` file. Only the root user should have a `0` in this field, and everything else should have a value greater than `1000` if it's a person, and less than `1000` if it's a service user.

  - Running `sudo less /etc/shadow` shows us that the user `adam` also has a UID of `0`.

  - Run `sudo nano /etc/shadow` to change the UID from `0` to something greater than `1000`.

Add a list of your findings to your research directory.

- Run `nano ~/research/permissions.txt` to create a document to store your findings, including everything from above.
