## Activity File: CIA Triad and Security Scenarios


In this activity, you will analyze a variety of brief security scenarios and identify which element of the CIA Triad (confidentiality, availability, and integrity) each situation is concerned with. 



**Scenarios**

- A hospital only allows authorized healthcare personnel within one department access to patient Personal Identifiable Information. When employees move to another department, that access is revoked.


- A technology firm maintains an alternate site that is running 24/7, and operations can be moved to this location in the event of a major disaster.

  

- Employees need to have key cards in order to enter their company offices.

  

- A company hashes their data files in order to monitor whether information has been tampered with. 

  

- Only authorized personnel at a company have `write` access to certain files. All other employees have only `read` access to these files. 

   

- A company employs redundant servers, which means that these systems are duplicated, and in the event of a malfunction, one server will fail over to other.

  

- A company's network infrastructure uses load balancers which will distribute the "load" of tasks such as file requests and data routing to a variety of servers, thereby ensuring that no single device is overburdened.

  

- A hacker uses a man-in-the-middle attack to intercept wireless traffic from users. 

  

- A hacker was able to crack a hashed message and change its contents. 

  

- A hacker launched a DDoS attack which flooded a website with unwanted traffic from a number of computers and took the site offline.
