### My First Shell Script Activity   
  
- You continue to be security analyts at Wonka Corp.
- Your manager needs your assistance with with creating a simple shell script to automate the awk and sed tasks you have done today on your log file
- This shell script can be provided to other security analysts so they can easily complete the same tasks you have ran today
- You are tasked with using nano to create a shell script with the awk and sed commands analyze a log file.

#### Instructions:

Using only the command line, complete the following tasks from within the `/student_day3/first_shell_script` folder in your Ubuntu VM:
  
  - Within this directory is a log file to analyze called "LogA.txt"
  - Use Nano to create a script called "Log_analysis.sh"
  - Within this script place the sed command and awk command used from the previous activities to analyze the LogA.txt file
    - Note, you can place your results in the same output file names used in the previous exercises
  - Run the command to confirm the commands run as expected.
