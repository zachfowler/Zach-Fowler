## Activity File: Threat Modeling, Step 5: Risk Analysis

In this exercise, you’ll use the threats you identified previously to complete a quantitative risk assessment. You will fill out a spreadsheet containing all of the risks you can identify, and use it to generate a risk matrix and heat map for GeldCorp.

Find the instructions below. Be sure to ask your instructors and classmates for help if you get stuck.



### Instructions

Open the provided spreadsheet: 
- [Risk Template](RiskTemplate.xlsx). 

If you do not have Microsoft Excel, please use Libre. 

Note the following tabs:

  - **Risk Assessment Data**: Contains descriptions of each risk, as well as probability and impact ratings.
  - **Risk Matrix**: Matrix displaying how many risks of each severity level you’ve identified.
  - **Heat Map**: A chart displaying whether you should make-do, monitor, manage, or mitigate each risk.
  - **Risk Ratings**: Information on GeldCorp’s risk rating guidelines.

Use the threats you identified in the previous exercise to fill in the most critical risks you can think of. 

- Fill out the risk description, probability, and impact cells for each risk.

 Next, consider less critical risks. Add at least five additional risks that are medium- or high-impact, but which are not very likely.
 
 When you have at least **ten** risks, click on the Risk Matrix tab. See at a glance how “at risk” GeldCorp is.

Click on the Heat Map. Scroll down, and click the Update Chart Data and Labels button on the left. Answer the following questions:

- Which risks should you mitigate?
  
- Which risks should you manage?

- Which risks should you monitor?

- Do these results align with your expectations?
