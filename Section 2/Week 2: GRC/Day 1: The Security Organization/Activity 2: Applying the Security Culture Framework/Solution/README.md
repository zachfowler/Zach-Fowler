### Review Security Culture Framework Part 1 (0:10)

- Below is a sample solution 

#### Measuring and Setting Goals

- **Security Implications**: This behavior is insecure because it enables non-employees to get into the building without providing identification.

- **Identifying Employees and Measuring Tailgating Rates**: One method involves simply counting how many employees engage in this behavior is simply to count. 
  
  - The organization should have the security team audit surveillance feeds to determine what percentage of employees entering secure buildings hold the door for those behind them. 
  
  - They can also keep track of which employees let others in. This number is the **Average Tailgating Rate**, which can be calculated for each secure building the company manages.

- **Target Goal**: Ideally, no employees entering secure buildings would allow unauthorized personnel in. The target threshold should thus be 0% of employees engaging in tailgating.

- **Potential Solutions**: the organization can:
  
    - **Develop and deliver a training**. The advantage is that this training might have a lasting effect on the company's security. The disadvantage is that it takes a long time to take effect.
    
    - **Hire 24/7 Guards**. The advantage is that this provides a direct solution to the problem. The disadvantage is that it raises costs, and doesn't change how employees think about the problem.
    
    - **Require Keycards for Access**: This is the most secure option, because it restricts access to only those who have been explicitly allowed to enter. The disadvantage is that it takes a lot of work to implement.

- **Timeline**: the company has over 500 employees. Training all of them will probably take a full year.

  - Hiring and assigning guards would be quick. This only takes as long as getting the budget approved and hiring the security personnelâ€”at most, this should take one quarter.

  -  Developing and implementing key card access would require at least a year, as it requires physical changes to the organization's properties; distributing ID cards; etc.

- We'll cover the topics of the additional questions later in the lesson. For now,  use the sample responses below as a starting point for discussion.

  - **C-Suite Personnel**: Most companies in this lesson have Chief Executive, Operating, Finance, and Information Security officers.

  - **Responsibilities of the Security Department**: The Security Department is responsible for protecting the CIA of the organization's data.

  - **Teams**: Most security teams have at least Incident Response and Networking teams. Those that build their own applications usually have an Application Security team as well.
